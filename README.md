[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/JelF/lamian/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/JelF/lamian)[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JelF/lamian.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JelF/lamian)


Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/lamian`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## TODO

- Add good threading (`Thread.new` core ext???)
